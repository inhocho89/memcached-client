# Memcached benchmark client application for Shenango

## Sample Usage (For client)
```
$ sudo ./mcclient [overload_control] [shenango_config] client [# threads] [server_ip] [workload] [max_key_index] [slo] [npeers] [offered_load]
```
[overload\_control]: currently supports `breakwater` (for Breakwater), `dagor` (for DAGOR), `seda` (for SEDA), and `nocontrol` (for no overload control).

[shenango\_config]: location of the Shenango configuration file

[\# threads]: the number of threads generating load

[server\_ip]: Memcached server IP

[workload]: currently supports `SET` (100\% SET requests), `GET` (100\% GET requests), and `USR` (99.8\% GET and 0.2\% SET requests)

[max\_key\_index]: the maximum number of keys

[slo]: service level objective (in us)

[npeers]: the number of agents

[offered\_load]: target request generation rate (in reqs/s)

## Sample Usage (For agent)
```
$ sudo ./mcclient [overload_control] [shenango_config] agent [client_ip]
```
[overload\_control]: currently supports `breakwater` (for Breakwater), `dagor` (for DAGOR), `seda` (for SEDA), and `nocontrol` (for no overload control).

[shenango\_config]: location of the Shenango configuration file

[client\_ip]: client IP to connect to
